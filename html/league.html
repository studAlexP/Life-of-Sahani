    <h1>League of Legends</h1>
    
    
    <p id="lolBlogpost"> Fun fact, and I feel like most League of Legends journeys have started this way, my friends from school 
        (which are still my close friends) convinced me to download it.That was ages ago in like 2013 or 
        so and I played one round and straight away I could not understand why they wasted my time like 
        that :’) I started to play back in 2015 because my friend Jakob convinced me to download it. But in 
        2015 Jakob sat down with me and explained me the whole game, every little detail. Now that I know 
        how most things works, I cannot comprehend how he was this patient League of Legends is probably 
        my favourite MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game. But considering I´ve been playing it for over 
        5 years… I´m still absolute shit at it xD But I absolutely enjoy playing with my friends!
        Currently I´m trying my best to get into gold with my best friend and I record those ranked sessions, 
        you can check them out on my YouTube Channel! 
        If you don´t know what League of Legends is, where have you been ma dude? 
        Nah just kidding, here is a link to where the game in thoroughly explained with fancy animations and everything:
