    <p> <h2>SAHANI BIO</h2></p>
    <p> <h3>Fun fact, and I feel like most League of Legends journeys have started this way,<br> my friends from school (which are still my close friends) convinced me to download it.<br>
        That was ages ago in like 2013 or so and I played one round and straight away I could not understand why they wasted my time like that :’)<br>
        I started to play back in 2015 because my friend Jakob convinced me to download it.<br> But in 2015 Jakob sat down with me and explained me the whole game, every little detail.<br>
        Now that I know how most things works, I cannot comprehend how he was this patient.<br>
        League of Legends is probably my favourite MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game.<br> But considering I´ve been playing it for over 5 years… I´m still absolute shit at it xD<br>
        But I absolutely enjoy playing with my friends!<br>
        Currently I´m trying my best to get into gold with my best friend and I record those ranked sessions<br>, you can check them out on my YouTube Channel!<br>
        If you don´t know what League of Legends is, where have you been ma dude? <br>
        Nah just kidding, here a <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/how-to-play/" target="_blank">link</a> to where the game in thoroughly explained with fancy animations and everything:
