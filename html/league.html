    <h1>League of Legends</h1>
    
    
    <p id="lolBlogpost"> Fun fact, and I feel like most League of Legends journeys have started this way, my friends from school <br>
        (which are still my close friends) convinced me to download it.That was ages ago in like 2013 or <br>
        so and I played one round and straight away I could not understand why they wasted my time like <br>
        that :’) I started to play back in 2015 because my friend Jakob convinced me to download it. But in <br>
        2015 Jakob sat down with me and explained me the whole game, every little detail. Now that I know <br>
        how most things works, I cannot comprehend how he was this patient League of Legends is probably <br>
        my favourite MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game. But considering I´ve been playing it for over <br>
        5 years… I´m still absolute shit at it xD But I absolutely enjoy playing with my friends! <br>
        Currently I´m trying my best to get into gold with my best friend and I record those ranked sessions, <br>
        you can check them out on my YouTube Channel! <br>
        If you don´t know what League of Legends is, where have you been ma dude? <br>
        Nah just kidding, here is a link to where the game in thoroughly explained with fancy animations and everything:
