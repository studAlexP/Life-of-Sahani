    <h1>Among Us</h1>
    <p>
        Among us is a multiplayer game. You can play with 4-10 friends.<br><br>
        This is how the game works: You all are crewmates on a spaceship and until you arrive at home you have to fix<br>
        certain things to keep the ship going. But there are one to two imposters among you, their goal is to eliminate<br>
        the crewmates. The imposters are trying to sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, frame the others for their kills.<br><br>
        During the time where everyone is fixing up the ship, no one can talk to maintain anonymity.<br>
        Once a body is reported, a meeting is started, and the surviving crew can debate who might have been the killer.<br>
        During the meeting everyone can vote for the person they think is the impostor. You are also able to skip and vote nobody, if you don´t want to risk voting off a crewmate.<br>
        If somebody gets the majority of the votes, they fly off the ship and are eliminated.<br>
        The crewmates can win if they either vote off the imposters or keep the ship maintained until they get home.<br>
        The imposters can win if they either kill all the crewmates or sabotage the ship and the crewmates don´t fix it in time.<br><br>
