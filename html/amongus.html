        <h1>Among Us</h1>
        <p>
            Among us is a multiplayer game. You can play with 4-10 friends.<br><br>
            This is how the game works: You all are crewmates on a spaceship and until you arrive at home you have to
            fix
            certain things to keep the ship going. But there are one to two imposters among you, their goal is to
            eliminate
            the crewmates. The imposters are trying to sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, frame the others for
            their kills.<br><br>
            During the time where everyone is fixing up the ship, no one can talk to maintain anonymity.
            Once a body is reported, a meeting is started, and the surviving crew can debate who might have been the
            killer.
            During the meeting everyone can vote for the person they think is the impostor. You are also able to skip
            and vote nobody, if you don´t want to risk voting off a crewmate.
            If somebody gets the majority of the votes, they fly off the ship and are eliminated.
            The crewmates can win if they either vote off the imposters or keep the ship maintained until they get home.
            The imposters can win if they either kill all the crewmates or sabotage the ship and the crewmates don´t fix
            it in time.<br><br>
