<h1>Resident Evil</h1>
    <p>Resident Evil, SUCH a good game!!! My best friend got most resident evil parts 
    for Christmas 2020 and firstly I watched him play with friends via Discord. 
    But he soon after started to play them in chronological order for his YouTube 
    channel, and I watched every part. At the moment he is done with Resident Evil 
    Code Veronica and next up is Resident Evil Zero. As I’ve watched him play, I 
    was really intrigued to play them myself. As of now, I enjoyed Resident Evil 
    2 the most and when I saw it was reduced to 15€, I had to buy it. Since I’m 
    absolute shit at those type of games, even tho I love em, I thought it was 
    probably funny to watch so I recorded myself playing it. As I predicted I 
    really am shit at it and I was never this disoriented in my life xD<br><br>
    So that’s how I started my Resident Evil journey and I hope I will have more time to continue playing it when I´m done with this semester.<br><br>
    If you haven´t watched my RE videos, watch em! I hope you won’t cry watching me be lost af :’)</p>
