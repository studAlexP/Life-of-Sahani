        <h1>Creative Corner</h1>

        <p> I´ve can’t even tell you since when I was interested in art. I have pictures
            of me drawing when I was tiny, when I was a kindergarden kid, a teenager
            and I still draw when ever I feel like I wanna get away from all the stress and
            everything. It’s extremely calming and stress relieving for me, to just sit down
            and draw into my sketching book! I used to paint a lot with acrylic, but I
            don’t have much time for stuff like that anymore, that’s why nowadays
            I tend to stick to my pencil and my trusty sketch book. I don´t really have
            any kind of style I stick to at all times, I go through phases. But those phases
            seem to always come back. One thing I´ve always love, and I don’t know
            why, is drawing eyes. And if I can say so myself, I really improves in drawing
            eyes over the years. Other than that, I loooove graffiti and drawing portraits,
            although I’m still not a as good in drawing portraits as I would like to.
            But I will keep practicing!! If you´re interested in speed drawing with good
            music in the background, then you have to check out my video where I
            try to draw a picture which I’ve found on Pinterest!</p>
