    <h1>Hey guys!</h1>
    <p id="me">
        My name is Sahani. I´m 23, from Austria/Vienna with roots from Sri Lanka. I 
        loooove being creative either old school with pen and paper or on my
        Computer. I've went to a few different school (I will not explain the school
        system in Austria now) but every school I went to after primary school had a 
        main focus on some type of informatics. In the school where I got my a-levels, 
        I learned a lot about web-design/photography/videography but also about 
        editing videos and pictures. Which even more intrigued me to start making my 
        own videos. I tried blogging in the past, I tried starting YouTube in the past, but 
        I was never too interested in sticking to do that on a regular….soo I dropped it. 
        But the pandemic and me failing my class during the first lockdown made me 
        have a TON of time. Also I have a few people in my close friends group who 
        also do YouTube and those people encouraged me even further to finally 
        actually start. So I did. And that is how this journey started for me. I have to 
        say I really have fun editing my videos and being as creative as I can be with them.
